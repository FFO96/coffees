# Coffee Challenge

This repository was born from a challenge presented to me by a company. Over time, it will evolve as I add new features, but I have left the prompt as a reference.

## How to get started

To get started with the challenge, first read this README carefully. Then you can go on and
read the READMEs inside the frontend and backend folders.

[Backend README](https://github.com/FFO96/coffees/blob/master/backend/README.md)

[Frontend README](https://github.com/FFO96/coffees/blob/master/frontend/README.md)

## Introduction

This code challenge is a project that already contains a very basic backend and frontend structure.

The backend and frontend are not connected at the beginning of the challenge.

Your task will be to implement some requirements using this repository, but you ultimately own the code. Don't feel like you need to stick to the structure provided, so feel free to refactor, readjust and improve it. Also, update this README if you want to describe your tech stack, give us instructions on how to run it, etc.

## Task Description

---

### Task 1 - Check the design

Our designers have provided us a Figma file (Not available for the public)

They expect us to build a fullstack web app that accurately follows their UI/UX requirements.

### Task 2 - Coffee list :coffee:

After running the frontend. You will see a list of items at "localhost:3000". This list is currently static on the frontend. The first task is to setup a database and connect the backend and the frontend to properly render the list with the data coming from the backend.

### Task 3 - Adding a :coffee:

Following the design, create a new page and place a form to add a new coffee.
You should be able to add a new coffee using the same structure/type (id, name, description, type, price and image url).
Don't worry about uploading the image, get a URL from Google, an image repository, or serve it as a static asset. You can prefill the image url input and set it to readonly if you like. However, the field needs to be submitted to the backend.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Before adding a new Coffee, you should validate if an existing record with the same `name` already exists.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Rules

1. The codebase provided is there to reduce some decision fatigue so you can focus on the coding. Please keep in mind that the decisions of folder structure, backend layers, architecture and other decisions have to be your own (‚ÄºÔ∏è).
2. Feel free to add any additional JS libraries and tell us in the README file why you chose them.
3. The frontend has to be built with React. Next.js is there to help you have a quick start and focus on the coding. You can replace it with React Vite or similar if you feel like it would be faster.
4. The data MUST be persisted in a database.
5. We love NestJS so we provided some basic backend boilerplate, but it is your choice to use it. You are free to use Next.js as a fullstack framework.
6. Provide a seeding mechanism to populate your DB.
7. Match the design in the Figma file.
8. If you don't feel comfortable using the `app` folder introduced in Next.js 13, you are allowed to use the `page` folder.

### üîç What we will check 

To be transparent, these are some things we consider important in the challenge:

1. The final outcome. The challenge is completed if the list of items is rendered on the frontend while fetching data from a backend server and we can add items to the list through the form.
2. General skills of programming. Besides checking the outcome of your running project, we will check your code for the following: readability, organization, robustness, layering, reusability, and extensibility.
3. Application of best practices and design patterns.
4. The outcome in comparison with the design.

### Extra Points

So you are finished and feel like showing us some more? Here are a few things that we'd love to see:

1. Testing. Your choice of what to test and how.
2. Add some CSS animations or use Framer Motion
3. If you haven't already, make the frontend SEO friendly
4. Deploy your application

## FAQ

---

- I am not familiar with Next.js and NestJS

  We don't expect you to know all the internals of these frameworks. What we do care about is the quality and the outcome of what you created. For the frontend, focus more on developing a good React application rather than the bells and whistles of Next.js. For the backend part, focus more on qualitative aspects like clean code and architecture and not NestJS specifics. The same applies if you choose to use Next.js as a fullstack framework.

- I don't want to use tailwind

  Feel free to use pure CSS (we love it), styled-components, CSS preprocessors like SASS or any other library that you are comfortable with. Just don't cheat and use a full-on component library like MaterialUI or Bootstrap üòâ We need to know your CSS skills!

- The starter code won't start

  Check that you are using the correct node versions. We have provided an `.nvmrc` file so you can set it to Node 18 if you are using `nvm`. Also, make sure that you have docker installed if you want to use the DB starter script provided by us.
  
- Some project dependencies are out of date. Can I update them?

  Absolutely! Also ping us and let us know about this.

## Feedback

### NOT DONE
Although the challenge is essentially finished, it is necessary to mention that the following minor adjustments remain to be applied, but I did not want to delay the submission any further.
- Image settings: Apply gradients and improve size settings.
- Import and apply fonts.
- Standardize the use of single and double quotes.

### Notes
- Despite using the color of the elements shown in Figma, it seems that some of them (for example, the gold) do not correspond to the expected color.

### Used imports
#### Backend
##### Typeorm
I decided to use this ORM to handle the data between the DB and the BE because it's the one I'm most used to. Using an ORM allows me to skip the development of functions to manipulate database registries and provides standardization.

#### Frontend
##### Classnames
The use of classnames allows me to join classNames with conditions in a very practical way.

##### React hook form
The form handling in react can be a bit cumbersome and react-hook-form allows me to do it in an organized way and obtain a cleaner code.

### What would you improve if given more time?
In this section I list the improvements I would make apart from those mentioned in the "Extra points" section. Although it should be noted that the first thing I would do would be unit and integration tests.

#### Common improvements
- Complete CRUDs.
- Error handling.
- Login and authentication: These elements do not seem to be necessary for the proper functionality of the application business logic, but they would serve as a knowledge sample of them.

#### Frontend improvements
- Improvement of the functions that send requests to the Backend: Creation of a single generic function for sending requests and improve the abstraction of the existing ones.
- Improvement of the filter and adding pagination: In case the number of coffees increased we would need to filter them better and not show them on one page.
- Improve component re-usability: For sake of scalability, I would try to make as many generic components as possible so that they can be re-used when needed. A styles list could also be made.

#### Backend improvements
- Use of a logging system: To make development and error detection easier, it is essential to have a log system.
- Improve seeding: Remove the current seeding from the service and implement a specific module for it.
- Add migrations: In a production environment it is necessary to use migrations so that all the changes in the DB are registered and can be applied and reverted when needed.
- Dependency injection: In order to achieve scalability, we can apply dependency injection to decouple the different layers and be prepared for possible changes in our application. Example: Change from a Postgres database to a MongoDB database.

### How was your experience doing this challenge?

Despite the time difficulties, I am very happy to have done the challenge. For a long time I have been focused mostly on Backend tasks and recently I wanted to improve my Frontend skills. This project has helped me to do so.

A few weeks ago I started learning Next.js and Tailwind and I was able to use this challenge to use them on a project for the first time.

It has helped me to strengthen concepts and learn new ones.

I have made every possible effort to dedicate time to this challenge, so please let me know the virtues and flaws of my work.
